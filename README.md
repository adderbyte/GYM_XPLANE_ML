##### XPlane_ML_Reinforcement_Learning_Autopilot
-------------------------------------------------
This project documents set up of Reinforcement learning environment for flight control. This will enable each user/learner/student/flight enthusiast to come with their own RL algorithm that can interact with and control in real time an aircraft in a simulation environment. The simulator used is ***X-Plane*** (the flight environment). This gives a realistic environment to work with together with parameters to keep the simulation as close to reality as possible.

##### Requirements
--------------------
* X Plane (Demo version) (main requirement)
  * [XPLane](https://www.x-plane.com/)
* XPlaneConnect (replace this with  different python udp connection file if required)
  * [XPlaneConnect](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect) [https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect]
* RL Algorithm (define  your own RL algorithm or use standard baslines. )
  *  [Tensorforce](https://github.com/reinforceio/tensorforce) 
  *  [RLLIB](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html)
  *  [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)
* Lua Programming/[FlyWithLua](https://www.x-plained.com/flywithlua-for-x-plane-11/) (for seamless interaction with XPlane)
